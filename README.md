# 🚀 Cloud-Native App Deployment on AWS EKS with Docker & Kubernetes

A complete DevOps pipeline project focused on building, containerizing, and deploying a Python-based application using modern cloud-native tools and infrastructure. This project demonstrates end-to-end deployment using **Docker**, **AWS ECR**, **Kubernetes**, and **Amazon EKS**, with additional automation via **Python SDKs**.

---

## 💡 Project Objective

This project is designed to showcase a **DevOps-first approach** to deploying microservices in the cloud using container orchestration and AWS-native services. While the sample application is built in Python using Flask, the **primary focus is on the DevOps toolchain and deployment lifecycle**.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

| Category      | Tools/Services Used                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Containerization | Docker                                              |
| Container Registry | AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)               |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes, AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)    |
| IaC/Automation | Python SDKs: `boto3` (for AWS), `kubernetes` (for K8s) |
| Monitoring App | Flask + psutil (for generating system metrics UI)  |
| CLI Tools | AWS CLI, kubectl                                        |

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

- How to **containerize** an app with Docker
- Push container images to **Amazon ECR**
- Create and manage **Amazon EKS clusters** using AWS CLI
- Automate **Kubernetes deployments and services** using Python
- Use `kubectl` to manage and inspect running pods, services, and deployments
- Perform **port forwarding** and access services running inside a K8s cluster

## 📦 Docker Image Creation

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t resource-monitor .

# Run it locally
docker run -p 5000:5000 resource-monitor
☁️ Push to AWS ECR
python
Copy
Edit
# Python script to create ECR repo
import boto3

ecr = boto3.client('ecr')
repo = ecr.create_repository(repositoryName='resource-monitor')
print("ECR URI:", repo['repository']['repositoryUri'])
Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker tag resource-monitor <ecr-uri>:latest
docker push <ecr-uri>:latest
☸️ Kubernetes Deployment on Amazon EKS
A Kubernetes cluster is created on Amazon EKS

Node groups are attached

A deployment and service are created programmatically using Python's Kubernetes client

python
Copy
Edit
# eks_deploy.py (sample snippet)
from kubernetes import client, config
config.load_kube_config()

# Deployment and Service objects defined here...
bash
Copy
Edit
python eks_deploy.py
🧪 Verifying the Setup
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
kubectl port-forward service/<service-name> 5000:5000
📌 Requirements
✅ AWS Account & CLI configured

✅ Docker

✅ kubectl

✅ Python 3.x

✅ IAM permissions for ECR & EKS

✅ VPC and networking for EKS cluster

🎯 Why This Project Matters
This project is ideal for anyone looking to:

Practice cloud-native app deployment

Gain hands-on experience with AWS EKS

Learn how to manage Kubernetes clusters and workloads

Understand Docker and container orchestration

Use Python SDKs for DevOps automation

It’s not about the app — it's about the deployment.
